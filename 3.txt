At this time of day, the cars flowed in a continuous brilliant stream, and among
buildings rose like columns of concrete and glass. Here in the world
sharp edges, people on the sidewalks looked miserable and restless.
They were well dressed, but somehow surprisingly similar to each other and everything before
one was in a hurry. They walked in discordant strings, spilled widely, seeing
a red traffic light, or the metallic sheen of cafe machines. They incessantly
looked around and fiddled with briefcases and handbags.
      Police cars with their sirens on made their way through this
crowd.
